## Task
{%- if task_statement %}
{{ task_statement }}
{%- elif task_name %}
Please complete an end-to-end, executable **{{ task_name }}** implementation.
{%- endif %}

**NOTE**: 
- This test comes from the `{{ library_name }}` library, and we have given you the content of this code repository under `/testbed/`, and you need to complete based on this code repository and supplement the files we specify. Remember, all your changes must be in this codebase, and changes that are not in this codebase will not be discovered and tested by us.
- We've already installed all the environments and dependencies you need, you don't need to install any dependencies, just focus on writing the code!
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: After completing the task, pytest will be used to test your implementation. **YOU MUST** match the exact interface shown in the **Interface Description** (I will give you this later)

You are forbidden to access the following URLs:
{{ black_links }}

Your final deliverable should be code under the `/testbed/` directory, and after completing the codebase, we will evaluate your completion and it is important that you complete our tasks with integrity and precision.

The final structure is like below.
```
/testbed                   # all your work should be put into this codebase and match the specific dir structure
├── dir1/
│   ├── file1.py
│   ├── ...
├── dir2/
```

## Interface Descriptions

### Clarification
The **Interface Description**  describes what the functions we are testing do and the input and output formats.

for example, you will get things like this:

Path: `{{ interface_code_example_path }}`
```python
{{ interface_code_example }}
```
The value of Path declares the path under which the following interface should be implemented and you must generate the interface class/function given to you under the specified path. 

In addition to the above path requirement, you may try to modify any file in codebase that you feel will help you accomplish our task. However, please note that you may cause our test to fail if you arbitrarily modify or delete some generic functions in existing files, so please be careful in completing your work.

What's more, in order to implement this functionality, some additional libraries etc. are often required, I don't restrict you to any libraries, you need to think about what dependencies you might need and fetch and install and call them yourself. The only thing is that you **MUST** fulfill the input/output format described by this interface, otherwise the test will not pass and you will get zero points for this feature.

And note that there may be not only one **Interface Description**, you should match all **Interface Description {n}**

{%- for key, value in all_vars.items() %}
  {%- if key.startswith('interface_description') and value %}
    {%- set interface_num = key.replace('interface_description', '') %}
    {%- set interface_code_key = 'interface_code' + interface_num %}
    {%- set interface_code_path_key = 'interface_code_path' + interface_num %}
    {%- if all_vars[interface_code_key] and all_vars[interface_code_path_key] %}

### Interface Description {{ interface_num }}
{{ value }}

Path: `{{ all_vars[interface_code_path_key] }}`
```python
{{ all_vars[interface_code_key] }}
```
    {%- endif %}
  {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}

Remember, **the interface template above is extremely important**. You must generate callable interfaces strictly according to the specified requirements, as this will directly determine whether you can pass our tests. If your implementation has incorrect naming or improper input/output formats, it may directly result in a 0% pass rate for this case.
